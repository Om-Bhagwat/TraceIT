## Install Metamask
**To connect your web3 js to the locally hosted truffle development we need metmask.**
You can download Chrome Extension At [MetaMask Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en)

Other Browser Users can find MetaMask On their respective browser stores.

And also Add the account key to the first account that is account[0] with the respective secret key.

Note: Every time you start from fresh always remember to reset your metmask acount as your localhost starts from zero but the metmask always store some cached data therefore it will thow error as the nonce would not match.
